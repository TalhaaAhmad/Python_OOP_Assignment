    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : The purpose of Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) is to allow developers to organize their code into modular, reusable, and maintainable structures by creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior. OOP in Python allows for the creation of classes and objects, which can be used to represent real-world entities and interact with each other in a structured and organized manner. This approach enables developers to write more efficient, scalable, and readable code."

    "Ans : An inheritance search in Python looks for an attribute in the object itself, the object's class, the first parent class, the second parent class (if any), and so on, until it reaches the top of the inheritance hierarchy (i.e., the built-in object class)."

A class object has both class attributes and methods as well as instance methods, while an instance object only has instance attributes and methods.\n"

Then, you can create an instance of the class by calling the class constructor, which is the name of the class followed by parentheses. The constructor creates a new object of the class type. Once the instance is created, you can set its attributes using dot notation and call its methods using dot notation as well."

A module is a file that can contain one or more classes along with other definitions and statements, while a class is a blueprint for creating objects with specific attributes and methods. You can define a class in a module, and then import that module into another module or script to use the class. This allows you to organize your code into reusable components and make it more modular. To use a class defined in a module, you need to import the module first, and then create an instance of the class using the module name and class name.\n"

For example, if you are writing a program that accepts user input for a password, you can use exception processing to ensure that the password meets minimum requirements, such as a minimum length or a requirement for special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 : Resource management: Exception processing can be used to ensure that resources, such as files or network connections, are properly managed and released when they are no longer needed. For example, if you are working with a file in your program, you can use exception processing to ensure that the file is closed properly, even if an error occurs during program execution.\n"

    "Ans : When an exception is raised in a Python script, you have several options for recovering from it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 : Catch the exception using a try-except block: You can wrap the code that is likely to raise an exception in a try block and handle any exceptions that are raised in the corresponding except block. This allows you to gracefully recover from the exception and continue executing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 : Reraise the exception: If you cannot handle the exception in the except block, you can re-raise it using the raise statement. This allows the exception to propagate up the call stack to a higher level of the program that may be better equipped to handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 : Ignore the exception: In some cases, you may choose to ignore the exception and allow the program to continue executing as if nothing happened. However, this is generally not recommended as it can lead to unpredictable behavior and may cause the program to enter an invalid state.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 : Log the exception: You can log the details of the exception to a file or a logging service to help diagnose the cause of the error and identify potential solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific approach you choose will depend on the nature of the exception and the requirements of your program. In general, it's a good practice to handle exceptions explicitly and provide meaningful feedback to the user about what went wrong, rather than allowing the program to crash or behave unpredictably.\n"

    "Ans : The raise statement in Python is used to raise or throw an exception explicitly in a program. When the program raises an exception, it stops the normal execution flow and jumps to the exception handler code that can handle that exception. The raise statement allows programmers to create their own custom exceptions or to re-raise an exception that was caught in a try-except block.\n",

The assert statement is similar to an if statement that raises an exception if the condition is not met.\n"

The main purpose of the with statement is to ensure that a specific code segment is executed with some predefined context that is properly set up and cleaned up.\n",

    "The with statement is similar to a try/finally block in that it guarantees that the cleanup code is executed even if the block of code raises an exception.
